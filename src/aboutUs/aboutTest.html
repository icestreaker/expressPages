  We are a group of individuals who work hard and who believe others
  can do well when given the chance. When a college or university loses
  accreditation, everyone loses. Not only do the students who attend
  those schools lose out by the money they have lost while attempting
  to attend, they also lose the ability to transfer all credits they
  earned at the school somewhere else. If a student were at the point
  of graduation, not only would they lose the chance for a diploma, they
  lose all of the hard work they put into getting the diploma.

    There are students who travel from one side of this country to the
    other to find a good school, there are students who jump hoops to gain
    an educational Visa or Green Card because they see the schools here
    as top notch. When these issue occur, not only do people outside of
    the country notice, the citizens will notice, and the combination of
    make our best schools look bad.

    We are helping the cause by providing the means a person can look up
    the various schools, see ratings, comments, and most importantly, what
    accreditation does the school have. There will also be information
    about the school to help the students plan the cost of attendance and
    if the school if good enough to hold out for the 2 years (AA degree)-
    or 5 years (BS/BA degree) the student would expect.

    It is a small step to assist in what is potentially becoming a larger
    problem. Our group wants to help, and this is our gift to others to help.

    Feel free to create an account and help us and others with this project.
