    We are a group of individuals who work hard and who believe others
    can do well when given the chance. When a college or university loses
    accreditation, everyone loses. Not only do the students who attend
    those schools lose out by the money they have lost while attempting
    to attend, they also lose the ability to transfer all credits they
    earned at the school somewhere else. If a student were at the point
    of graduation, not only would they lose the chance for a diploma, they
    lose all of the hard work they put into getting the diploma.

      There are students who travel from one side of this country to the
      other to find a good school, there are students who jump hoops to gain
      an educational Visa or Green Card because they see the schools here
      as top notch. When these issue occur, not only do people outside of
      the country notice, the citizens will notice, and the combination of
      make our best schools look bad.

      We are helping the cause by providing the means a person can look up
      the various schools, see ratings, comments, and most importantly, what
      accreditation does the school have. There will also be information
      about the school to help the students plan the cost of attendance and
      if the school if good enough to hold out for the 2 years (AA degree)-
      or 5 years (BS/BA degree) the student would expect.

      It is a small step to assist in what is potentially becoming a larger
      problem. Our group wants to help, and this is our gift to others to help.
